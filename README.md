# Porcupine4Win

Set porcupine as your default web browser. When you click a link, porcupine will copy the URL to your clipboard and notify you about this. This way you'll never accidentally open a link you don't want to, and you can easily choose which browser to load it in.

## Installation

This setup assumes that you are not using Microsoft Edge at all.

1. Download [the binary](https://github.com/cristianrz/porcupine4win/releases)
2. Make a backup of Microsoft Edge executable on: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application`
3. Replace `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe` with `porcupine4win.exe`
4. Make sure Microsft Edge is your default browser
5. Profit
